# GTK
Related to GTK programming in C

People who want to start with GTK programming often find themselves stuck in the installation and setting up of GTK. There are limited tutorials which show the entire installation procedure. Even I had difficulties in the beginning. 
I have created "documentation.txt" which details the installation of GTK 3.0 and its integration with Codeblocks IDE on Windows 8 (my current OS).
1) documentation.txt - deals with the installation procedure
   mingw-get-setup - allows you to run the GTK applications from command line
   gtk+-bundle_3.6.4-20130921_win32.zip - Download the zip file on your own. I haven't uploaded it.
   CodeBlocks 16.01 - The IDE I am using. Download the same on your own. In case you have any kind of difficulties in downloading 
                      GTK zip file or code blocks setup file, do inform me. I'll provide you with the same

/* If anyone can provide the installation procedure of GTK 3.0 on Linux variants, please do it */
