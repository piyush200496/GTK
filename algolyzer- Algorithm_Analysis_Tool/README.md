ALGOLYZER- Algorithm Analysis Tool
=======

Minor project using C and GTK. “Algolyzer” – Algorithm Analysis Tool Based on Execution Time is a software tool which benchmarks runtime performances of various algorithms relevant for operations such as searching, sorting, etc. with custom data inputs. 

It serves as an educational tool demonstrating non-existence of an ideal algorithm; choice of algorithm depends on application and also patterns of input dataset type. 
## Sorting performed
The two pie charts are indicative of two separate text files that were used to provide inputs for the sorting operation. The percentage indicates the number of test cases out of total for which that particular algorithm performed best. Totaltime indicates the overall time taken by that algorithm for all the test cases taken together.
